      "detailed_analysis": "Section 377 IPC, which criminalized consensual homosexual acts, was challenged in several cases leading to significant judgments. The key Supreme Court rulings include: \n1. **Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation (2014)**: The Supreme Court set aside a Delhi High Court judgment that had decriminalized homosexuality, effectively reinstating Section 377 IPC.\n2. **Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)**: The Supreme Court unanimously held that consensual same-sex relationships between adults are not a crime, thus decriminalizing part of Section 377 IPC. This judgment was hailed as a milestone for LGBT rights in India. It recognized the right to equality and privacy for homosexual individuals and invalidated previous legal interpretations restricting these rights.",
